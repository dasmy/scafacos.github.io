# ScaFaCoS - Scalable Fast Coulomb Solvers

### About the Library

**ScaFaCoS** is a library of scalable fast coulomb solvers.

This is a network project of [German research groups](./partners.html)
working on a unified parallel library for various methods to solve
electrostatic (and gravitational) problems in large particle
simulations. The main focus of the project is to provide efficiently
implemented methods for electrostatic problems in order to scale up to
thousands of processors.

You can freely [**download**](./download.html) the library. If
you use it in your research, please cite our [publication](./publications.html).


### Funding

- This work was supported by the German Ministery of Science and Education (BMBF) under grant 01IH08001.
- Parts of this work were supported by the German Science Foundation (DFG) via the SFB 716 program.
- We are grateful to the J&uuml;lich Supercomputing Center for providing the computational
  resources on J&uuml;lich Blue Gene/P (JUGENE) and J&uuml;lich Research on Petaflop Architectures (JUROPA).
