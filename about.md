ScaFaCoS is a library of scalable fast coulomb solvers.

This is a network project of German research groups working on a unified
parallel library for various methods to solve electrostatic (and
gravitational) problems in large particle simulations. The project is
financed by the German Ministery of Education and Science (BMBF) under
contract number 01 IH 08001 A-D. Main focus of the project is to provide
methods for electrostatic problems and to implement efficient parallel
methods in order to scale up to thousands of processors.
